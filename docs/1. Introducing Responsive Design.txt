1.1 What is responsive design?
===============================

Screen sizes are getting smaller and bigger. 

Responsive design is a design strategy that is centered on designing your content so that it responds to the environment it's encountered in.

Three fundamental techniques for responsive design: - Fluid grids for flexible layouts, 
- Media queries to help you adapt content to specific screen sizes. 
- Flexible images and media that respond to changes in screen sizes as well.

1.2 Exploring the need for responsive design
============================================

In the pass resolution should be: 
- 640 x 480 satndard screen size
- 800 x 600
- 1024 x 7568

Over the last five years we've seen some dramatic changes in how sites are viewed.

Through using the evolving techniques of responsive design, we can create a design that responds to each of these environments and offers users an experience that conforms to the context in which it's viewed.

So while responsive design might be seen as a new way to approach designing sites right now, I believe in a few years it will simply be "the way" we design.
