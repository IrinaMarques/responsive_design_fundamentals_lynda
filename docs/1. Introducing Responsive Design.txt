1.1 What is responsive design?
===============================

Screen sizes are getting smaller and bigger. 

Responsive design is a design strategy that is centered on designing your content so that it responds to the environment it's encountered in.

Three fundamental techniques for responsive design: - Fluid grids for flexible layouts, 
- Media queries to help you adapt content to specific screen sizes. 
- Flexible images and media that respond to changes in screen sizes as well.

1.2 Exploring the need for responsive design
============================================

In the pass resolution should be: 
- 640 x 480 satndard screen size
- 800 x 600
- 1024 x 7568

Over the last five years we've seen some dramatic changes in how sites are viewed.

Through using the evolving techniques of responsive design, we can create a design that responds to each of these environments and offers users an experience that conforms to the context in which it's viewed.

So while responsive design might be seen as a new way to approach designing sites right now, I believe in a few years it will simply be "the way" we design.

1.3 What makes sites responsive?
================================

HTML:
- Clean code - Clean, well-structured HTML helps create content that is meaningful and easier to manipulate based on context.
- Proper semantics - Care the designer gives when planning the site's semantics in uses of ID and class attributes can go a long way towards making the site more responsive. 
- HTML5 - Includes a few features that helps sites be more functional across multiple devices.

CSS:
- Media queries - Allow us to apply different sets of styles based on factors such as screen size, orientation, or resolution.
- Fluid layouts - Responsive layouts are typically fluid in nature so that they can flex to fit the screen on which they're viewed. 
- Transitions -  Newer CSS features, such as transitions and transforms, allow designers to change how content displays and interacts with the user without requiring additional scripting.
- CSS graphics - Help reduce the amount of resources requested by the page by replacing icons or other images.

Javascripts:
- Resource loading 
- Adaptive media 
- Device funtionality
It's primarily used to control resource loading, supply the correct images and media based on the needs of different devices, and to add device-specific functionality like geolocation and touch events to sites.
