===============================

Screen sizes are getting smaller and bigger. 

Responsive design is a design strategy that is centered on designing your content so that it responds to the environment it's encountered in.

Three fundamental techniques for responsive design: - Fluid grids for flexible layouts, 
- Media queries to help you adapt content to specific screen sizes. 
- Flexible images and media that respond to changes in screen sizes as well.
